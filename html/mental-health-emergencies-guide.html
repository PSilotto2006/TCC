        <h1><strong>Anxiety and Depression Crisis: What It Is and Symptoms</strong> <strong>UNDERSTAND IN SUMMARY</strong></h1>
        <p>An anxiety crisis, also known as a panic attack or panic crisis, is a sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort that peaks quickly and is accompanied by a series of physical and emotional symptoms. These crises can occur unexpectedly and are often very frightening, even though they do not represent a real danger.

            <p><strong>Symptoms of an Anxiety Crisis
            During an anxiety crisis, a person may experience a combination of the following symptoms:</strong></p>
            
            <li>Palpitations or increased heart rate</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>Excessive sweating</li>
            <li>Tremors or shaking</li>
            <li>Feeling of choking</li>
            <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
            <li>Nausea or abdominal discomfort</li>
            <li>Dizziness, vertigo, or feeling faint</li>
            These symptoms can last from a few minutes to about half an hour, but the emotional impact can last much longer. In some cases, people may develop an intense fear of having another crisis, which can lead to avoiding certain situations or places (a behavior known as agoraphobia).</p>

        <h2> During an anxiety crisis, it is important to take steps to try to alleviate the symptoms and regain control. Here are some actions you can try:</h2>

            <li><strong>1. Controlled Breathing:</strong> 
             Breathe slowly and deeply: Inhale through your nose counting to four, hold your breath for four seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth counting to four. This helps calm the nervous system.</li> 
             <li><strong>2. Focus on Something Physical:</strong> 
             Hold an object: Focus on something you can touch, such as a small object, and observe its details. This helps divert attention from anxious thoughts.</li>
             <li><strong>3. Practice Mindfulness:</strong> 
             Focus on the present: Observe what is happening around you without judgment, focusing on sounds, colors, or physical sensations. This can help keep your mind away from worries.</li>
             <li><strong>4. Positive Affirmations:</strong>
             Repeat to yourself: Say reassuring phrases, like "This will pass" or "I am safe," to help reprogram your mind and reduce anxiety.</li>
             <li><strong>5. Move:</strong>
             Walk or stretch: Simple movements can help dissipate anxious energy and reduce tension.</li></p>

        <h2><strong>What Is a Depressive Crisis?</strong></h2>
            A depressive crisis is an intense period of worsening depression symptoms. During this crisis, a person may feel deep sadness, hopelessness, lack of energy, and loss of interest in activities that were once pleasurable. These feelings may be accompanied by intense negative thoughts, such as feeling worthless or guilty, and in severe cases, suicidal thoughts may arise.
            Final Considerations: A depressive crisis is a critical moment that requires immediate attention and care. Seeking professional help and support from loved ones is essential to navigate this period. Remember that the crisis, no matter how painful, is temporary, and with proper care, relief and recovery are possible.

<div class="block">
    <p></p><strong>Necessary Care During a Depressive Crisis</strong>
    <li>1. Seek Immediate Professional Help
    Contact a therapist or psychiatrist: A mental health professional can help assess the severity of the crisis and provide appropriate treatment, which may include therapy, medication, or both.
    Emergency services: In situations where there is a risk of suicide or self-harm, it is crucial to seek emergency help immediately. This may include going to a hospital or calling an emergency hotline.</li> 
    <li>2. Support Network
    Talk to someone you trust: During a crisis, sharing your feelings with friends or family can help relieve some of the emotional burden. The presence of someone can offer comfort and safety.
    Avoid isolation: Staying connected with people who care about you is essential, even if it is difficult.</li>
    <li>3. Physical and Emotional Self-Care
    Maintain a basic routine: Even if it seems impossible, try to maintain a basic routine, such as eating regularly and getting enough sleep, which can help stabilize your mood.
    Engage in comforting activities: This may include simple things like listening to relaxing music, taking a warm bath, or doing a light activity that helps distract your mind.</li>
    <li>4. Avoid Making Important Decisions
    Postpone decisions: During a depressive crisis, the ability to make decisions may be impaired. Try to avoid making significant decisions until you feel more balanced.</li>
    <li>5. Breathing and Relaxation Techniques
    Deep breathing and mindfulness: Practices like meditation or deep breathing can help calm the mind and reduce anxiety.
    Light exercises: Light physical activities, such as a walk, can help improve mood through the release of endorphins.</li>
    <li>6. Avoid Harmful Substances
    Do not resort to alcohol or drugs: These substances can worsen depression symptoms and hinder recovery.</li>
